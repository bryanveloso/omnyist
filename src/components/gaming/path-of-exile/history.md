While I started playing Path of Exile in earnest during the Ultimatum league, it wasn't the first time I had played the game. To be honest, like many others, I was too used to the systems—and for me specifically, the visual style—of the Diablo games. I had co-streamed the game with a couple of friends from an old stream team of mine, but I didn't get past the first act. Everything felt slow and that skill tree™ was menacing.

I don't exactly remember what made me want to give the game another shot, but my friend [Ruu](https://ruu-tv.carrd.co/) probably had something to do with it.
