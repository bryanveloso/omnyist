## The Kickstarter

For some reason, 3D printing never appealed to me in its early days. Of course I knew about the hobby, but for better or for worse, nothing I saw really appealed to me. That was until I had gotten an ad from Anker, promoting a Kickstarter for a new 3D printer, the AnkerMake M5. From the pictures it looked really slick, a far cry from the Prusa machines I had seen during the pandemic. I was intrigued, and I backed it, and promprly forgot about it.

When the printer finally arrived, it sat in my garage for at least a month. Didn't think I had space for it, and I didn't feel like I had a use for it either. That changed when I wanted to print a mount for the [DExx-vd_isl](https://github.com/marqs85/DExx-vd_isl)---which served as a stop-gap for the Open Source Scan Converter Pro that had not yet been released. So, I opened up some CAD software for the first time since AutoCAD for DOS, and designed a mount. I set up the AnkerMake M5 and printed that mount alongside a bunch of other models that came with the printer. That's when everything clicked.
